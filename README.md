# Story of a Thieving Dimension
 Shoot 'em up inspired by the Touhou series using characters and settings of my own creation

This is on-pause at the moment and I am still learning my way around this engine using a tutorial at https://sparen.github.io/ph3tutorials/ph3tutorials.html

UPDATE: More than likely, this game will be put on hold for the foreseeable future. I may come back to it later, but for the sake
of my mental health and my growing frustrations with this engine, I am going to be putting this on pause.

I had naively thought that since the Touhou series was created by essentially one guy, that I could do the same and that the scope was
at a manageable level. I now realize that I am not ZUN developing Touhou 6, and that I bit off far more than I could chew.

This story is still one that I want told, however, and so I will possibly be finding a different method through which to tell it.

For now, this will be an archive for myself as well as a alerning experience.
